%description
TRAC-IK is a faster, significantly more reliable drop-in replacement for KDL's
pseudoinverse Jacobian solver. The TRAC-IK library has a very similar API to
KDL's IK solver calls, except that the user passes a maximum time instead of a
maximum number of search iterations. Additionally, TRAC-IK allows for error
tolerances to be set independently for each Cartesian dimension
(x,y,z,roll,pitch.yaw).

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
